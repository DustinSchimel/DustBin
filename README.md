# DustBin
DustBin is a Java game that gives you a pixel sandbox environment to interact with to your hearts content!

  - Elements interact with gravity and each other
  - Save created levels for later use
  - Slow motion and pausing features allow for even better fine touches

### Purpose
This was a project I originally added onto for a CS class I took in 2018. This repo is an updated version of [this](https://github.com/Xerphy/SandGame) one. This repo is made available as well as the release to enable them to be viewed as a simple portfolio piece. I don't plan on updating this game in the foreseeable future.

### Installation
Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/Xerphy/DustBin/releases) page and download the latest zip. Once the zip is extracted, launch the DustBin.exe to start the game.

### Notes
  - Levels are automatically saved within the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
  - Level files can be renamed after they are saved manually
  - Levels must be loaded from the same directory that the DustBin.exe file is in
